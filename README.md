# Eman Stories

**Goal:** Procedurally-generate hyrbrid action-RPG with a unique story and world each time you play. Stories are based on solid moral values, and hopefully give you an eman rush!

Web-deployed game (HTML5), probably with an HD desktop version for Steam.

# Architectural Goals

- Same story number generates the same game every time (challenge mode).
- Configure whatever gameplay options you want (eg. trigger battle)
- Dynamic hue rotation! (Seriously.)
- Components with code. Go as fast as possible.
