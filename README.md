# Eman Stories

Procedurally-generate hyrbrid action-RPG with a unique story and world each time.

# Architectural Goals

- As unit-testable as possible. Keep things separate from "view" (HaxeFlixel) code.
- Same story number generates the same game every time. (Challenge mode.)
- Dynamic hue rotation! (Seriously.)
